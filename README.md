Releases can be found here: https://github.com/Flaxbeard/Thaumic_Exploration/releases

Thaumic Exploration is a WIP add-on for Thaumcraft 4 that adds a variety of new content. Currently, Thaumic Exploration is in early alpha. 

Current content includes:

 - Rotten flesh purification
 - Zombie brain purification, used in Advanced Golems and the Think Tank.
 - Binding seals for Warded Jars and Chests. These seals allow the player to create networks of jars or chests with shared inventories.
 - Amber wand core, an advanced regenerative wand core.
 - Transmutative wand core, a wand core that tries to even out collected vis.
 - The Think Tank, a monstrosity that converts books and enchanted books into the ever-elusive knowledge fragments.
 - Work in progress Necromancy focus, allowing you to raise the dead.
